**Project Description**: The aim of this project is to analyse bicycle sales data, identify customers who have or have not bought bicycles from the store, and draw any general conclusions from the data.

**Dataset:** Before data cleaning and preparation, the dataset had 1027 rows and 13 columns; after cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, the dataset had 1001 rows and 14 columns.

**Data Cleaning and Data Preparation**: To make sure the data is clean, organised, and consistent, the following steps were taken:
- Most important step I started with is to copy the data into new spreadsheet before any data cleaning and preparation.
- Started the cleaning by deleting duplicates.
- I double-checked that each column's heading contained a meaningful description, and I quickly glanced over each column's overall data to check for any errors or inconsistencies.
- In order to make these columns consistent and have a proper description, I replaced the single letters "M" and "S" in the marital status column with complete words to read "Married" and "Single." I also replaced the single letters "F" & "M" in the gender column to complete words to read "Female" and "Male" respectively.
- Using the if formula on the age column, I made a new column that divided the age into the adult, middle-aged, and old adults categories.


Following the completion of all data cleaning and preparation steps, I began a thorough data analysis. A summary of my data insights includes

**Summary of Findings**
- The company hasn't sold many bicycles, according to the customer data, which shows that only 48% of customers bought bicycles while 52% opted not to.
- Most bicycle purchase were made from North America, with europe recording the least purchase.
- It is surprising to see that in terms of occupation, customers under preofessional purchased bicycles more that other occupations.
-  With respect to age, middle aged people purchased bicycle more than people in other age brackets.
-  It is also interesting to see that people that purchased bicycles have short travel distance between 0-2 miles
